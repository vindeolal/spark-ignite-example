Apache Ignite memory-centric platform is based on the durable memory architecture that allows storing and processing data and indexes
both in memory and on disk when the Ignite Native Persistence feature is enabled. The durable memory architecture helps achieve
in-memory performance with the durability of disk using all the available resources of the cluster.
Ignite's durable memory operates in a way similar to the virtual memory of operating systems, such as Linux. However, one significant
difference between these two types of architecture is that the durable memory, whenever persistence is enabled, will always treat the
disk as the superset of the data, capable of surviving crashes and restarts, while the traditional virtual memory uses the disk only as
a swap extension, which gets erased once the process stops.
Ignite Persistence is the most flexible, scalable, and convenient way of persisting data in Ignite. It is widely used in scenarios where
applications need a distributed memory-centric database.
